| broad-scale environmental context             | mandatory     | Report the major environmental system the sample or specimen came from. the system(s) identified should have a coarse spatial grain, to provide the general environmental context of where the sampling was done (e.g. in the desert or a rainforest). we recommend using subclasses of envo’s biome class: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/envo_00000428. envo documentation about how to use the field: https://github.com/environmentontology/envo/wiki/using-envo-with-mixs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| local environmental context                   | mandatory     | Report the entity or entities which are in the sample or specimen’s local vicinity and which you believe have significant causal influences on your sample or specimen. we recommend using envo terms which are of smaller spatial grain than your entry for "broad-scale environmental context". terms, such as anatomical sites, from other obo library ontologies which interoperate with envo (e.g. uberon) are accepted in this field. envo documentation about how to use the field: https://github.com/environmentontology/envo/wiki/using-envo-with-mixs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| source material identifiers                   | optional      | A unique identifier assigned to a material sample (as defined by http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/materialsampleid, and as opposed to a particular digital record of a material sample) used for extracting nucleic acids, and subsequent sequencing. the identifier can refer either to the original material collected or to any derived sub-samples. the insdc qualifiers /specimen_voucher, /bio_material, or /culture_collection may or may not share the same value as the source_mat_id field. for instance, the /specimen_voucher qualifier and source_mat_id may both contain 'uam:herps:14' , referring to both the specimen voucher and sampled tissue with the same identifier. however, the /culture_collection qualifier may refer to a value from an initial culture (e.g. atcc:11775) while source_mat_id would refer to an identifier from some derived culture from which the nucleic acids were extracted (e.g. xatc123 or ark:/2154/r2). |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
