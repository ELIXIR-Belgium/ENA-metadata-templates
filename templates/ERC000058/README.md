| sample measured depth                                  | optional      | In non deviated well, measured depth is equal to the true vertical depth, tvd (tvd=tvdss plus the reference or datum it refers to). in deviated wells, the md is the length of trajectory of the borehole measured from the same reference or datum. common datums used are ground level (gl), drilling rig floor (df), rotary table (rt), kelly bushing (kb) and mean sea level (msl). if "other" is specified, please propose entry in "additional info" field (Units: mm)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| corrosion rate at sample location                      | optional      | Metal corrosion rate is the speed of metal deterioration due to environmental conditions. as environmental conditions change corrosion rates change accordingly. therefore, long term corrosion rates are generally more informative than short term rates and for that reason they are preferred during reporting. in the case of suspected mic, corrosion rate measurements at the time of sampling might provide insights into the involvement of certain microbial community members in mic as well as potential microbial interplays                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| broad-scale environmental context                      | optional      | Report the major environmental system the sample or specimen came from. the system(s) identified should have a coarse spatial grain, to provide the general environmental context of where the sampling was done (e.g. in the desert or a rainforest). we recommend using subclasses of envo’s biome class: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/envo_00000428. envo documentation about how to use the field: https://github.com/environmentontology/envo/wiki/using-envo-with-mixs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| local environmental context                            | optional      | Report the entity or entities which are in the sample or specimen’s local vicinity and which you believe have significant causal influences on your sample or specimen. we recommend using envo terms which are of smaller spatial grain than your entry for "broad-scale environmental context". terms, such as anatomical sites, from other obo library ontologies which interoperate with envo (e.g. uberon) are accepted in this field. envo documentation about how to use the field: https://github.com/environmentontology/envo/wiki/using-envo-with-mixs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| sample salinity                                        | optional      | Salinity is the total concentration of all dissolved salts in a liquid or solid (in the form of an extract obtained by centrifugation) sample. while salinity can be measured by a complete chemical analysis, this method is difficult and time consuming. more often, it is instead derived from the conductivity measurement. this is known as practical salinity. these derivations compare the specific conductance of the sample to a salinity standard such as seawater (Units: psu)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| salinity                                               | optional      | The total concentration of all dissolved salts in a liquid or solid sample. while salinity can be measured by a complete chemical analysis, this method is difficult and time consuming. more often, it is instead derived from the conductivity measurement. this is known as practical salinity. these derivations compare the specific conductance of the sample to a salinity standard such as seawater.

| source material identifiers                            | optional      | A unique identifier assigned to a material sample (as defined by http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/materialsampleid, and as opposed to a particular digital record of a material sample) used for extracting nucleic acids, and subsequent sequencing. the identifier can refer either to the original material collected or to any derived sub-samples. the insdc qualifiers /specimen_voucher, /bio_material, or /culture_collection may or may not share the same value as the source_mat_id field. for instance, the /specimen_voucher qualifier and source_mat_id may both contain 'uam:herps:14' , referring to both the specimen voucher and sampled tissue with the same identifier. however, the /culture_collection qualifier may refer to a value from an initial culture (e.g. atcc:11775) while source_mat_id would refer to an identifier from some derived culture from which the nucleic acids were extracted (e.g. xatc123 or ark:/2154/r2). |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
