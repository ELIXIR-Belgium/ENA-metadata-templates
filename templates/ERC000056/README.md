# ERC000056: GSC MIxS Food and Production

Genomic Standards Consortium package extension for reporting of measurements and observations obtained from the environment where the sample was obtained. By choosing the environmental package, a selection of fields can be made from a relevant subsets of the GSC terms. This package is a combination of the four food extensions (MIxS-food-animal and animal feed, MIxS-food-farm environment, MIxS-food-food production facility, MIxS-food-human foods).

## Study

A Study is a container for a sequencing investigation that may comprise multiple experiments. The Study has an overall goal, but is otherwise minimally defined in the SRA.  A Study is composed of a descriptor, zero or more experiments, and zero or more analyses. The submitter may decorate the Study with web links and properties.

## Experiment

An experiment object serves as a metadata record encapsulating essential details about a sequencing experiment, including the experimental design, sequencing type, and relevant parameters. This information enhances the interpretation and contextual understanding of nucleotide sequences submitted to the archive.

## Sample

A Sample defines an isolate of sequenceable material upon which sequencing experiments can be based.  The Sample object may be a surrogate for taxonomy accession or an anonymized individual identifier.  Or, it may fully specify provenance and isolation method of the starting material.

| source_material_identifiers                                          | optional      | A unique identifier assigned to a material sample (as defined by http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/materialsampleid, and as opposed to a particular digital record of a material sample) used for extracting nucleic acids, and subsequent sequencing. the identifier can refer either to the original material collected or to any derived sub-samples. the insdc qualifiers /specimen_voucher, /bio_material, or /culture_collection may or may not share the same value as the source_mat_id field. for instance, the /specimen_voucher qualifier and source_mat_id may both contain 'uam:herps:14' , referring to both the specimen voucher and sampled tissue with the same identifier. however, the /culture_collection qualifier may refer to a value from an initial culture (e.g. atcc:11775) while source_mat_id would refer to an identifier from some derived culture from which the nucleic acids were extracted (e.g. xatc123 or ark:/2154/r2).

| interagency_food_safety_analytics_collaboration_ifsac_category       | optional      | The ifsac food categorization scheme has five distinct levels to which foods can be assigned, depending upon the type of food. first, foods are assigned to one of four food groups (aquatic animals, land animals, plants, and other). food groups include increasingly specific food categories; dairy, eggs, meat and poultry, and game are in the land animal food group, and the category meat and poultry is further subdivided into more specific categories of meat (beef, pork, other meat) and poultry (chicken, turkey, other poultry). finally, foods are differentiated by differences in food processing (such as pasteurized fluid dairy products, unpasteurized fluid dairy products, pasteurized solid and semi-solid dairy products, and unpasteurized solid and semi-solid dairy products. an ifsac food category chart is available from https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/ifsac/projects/food-categorization-scheme.html pmid: 28926300.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| food_traceability_list_category                                      | optional      | The fda is proposing to establish additional traceability recordkeeping requirements (beyond what is already required in existing regulations) for persons who manufacture, process, pack, or hold foods the agency has designated for inclusion on the food traceability list. the food traceability list (ftl) identifies the foods for which the additional traceability records described in the proposed rule would be required. the term “food traceability list” (ftl) refers not only to the foods specifically listed (https://www.fda.gov/media/142303/download), but also to any foods that contain listed foods as ingredients.
